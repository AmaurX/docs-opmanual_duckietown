## Straight roads {#dt-ops-tiles-straight status=ready}

Each straight road segment has:

* Solid white markings on the outer sides of the lanes (right of direction of travel);
* Dashed yellow markings at the center;
* Each lane is 21 cm wide (from end of white to beginning of yellow).

TODO: add explicative pic

Protip: instead of measuring and cutting each yellow segment individually, tape several parallel lines of yellow tape on the back of a tile, take a ruler and a sharp cutter, and proceed to cut them in batch. You can then have fun placing them at exactly 2.5 cm from each other!


## Curved roads {#dt-ops-tiles-curves status=ready}

Each curved road segment has:

* Solid white markings on the outer sides of the lanes (right of direction of travel);
* Dashed yellow markings at the center;
* Each lane is 21 cm wide (from end of white to beginning of yellow).

Building curves in Duckietown is an art which we will let you discover on your own!


## Intersections {#dt-ops-tiles-intersections status=ready}

Each intersection road segment (3- or 4- way) has:

* Solid white markings on the outer sides of the lanes (right of direction of travel);
* Dashed yellow markings at the center;
* Each lane is 21 cm wide (from end of white to beginning of yellow);
* Solid red markings as stop signs.

Start by placing the red markings. You can then cover them with the white and yellow ones.


TODO: add links to laser cutting templates for precise building (contact jacopo@duckietown.org in case of need).
